            <h3>K/DA, Riot Games’ pop girl group, explained</h3>
            <p>Have you seen a girl with a demon face bandanna all over your social media feeds? Or maybe a fox girl with dyed blonde hair? It’s all part of the world of League of Legends, which has its own fictional K-pop group, who appeared at this weekend’s World Championship Finals.
                If you’re not immersed in League of Legends, that may be a lot to absorb. But what you need to know is that League of Legends developer Riot Games debuted a new song and video, “Pop/Stars,” at the game’s championship in Incheon, South Korea. The band behind the song is known as K/DA, and it’s made up of real singers, including two members of the K-pop group (G)I-dle. The video for “Pop/Star” stars League characters, however, and the whole thing is an elaborate promotion designed to sell new skins for the game.
                And people online — even people who don’t play League of Legends — are absolutely eating it up. Akali, especially.</p>
                <p>The group, K/DA, is how Riot is promoting League of Legends’ new line of character cosmetics for four champions: Ahri, Akali, Evelynn and Kai’Sa. Each champion was given a special backstory that goes with their skins, as well as a real-life counterpart during the opening ceremony at Worlds. According to the League of Legends website, Ahri and Evelynn are the lead vocalists, Kai’Sa is the main dancer and Akali is the rapper.
                    Ahri is a nine-tailed fox mage League champion — and is one of the most well known champs in the game. She gets all the flashiest skins and has a ton of fans. Her abilities in-game feature a lot of dashing around, and a charm, which forces enemies to walk toward her, in love. Miyeon of real-world K-pop group (G)I-dle sings her parts in the song.</p>
